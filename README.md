##Deploy an applicationï»¿
Note: I already setuped all the stuff for the heroku. To deploy the application to Heroku using Git, open the terminal and follow the steps below:
Commit changes made in the previous section locally:

Commit changes made in the previous section locally:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare app for deploying"
```
### Login to Heroku CLI:

```heroku login```
### Create a Heroku application using the heroku create command. You need to replace ktor-sample-heroku with a name of your application:

```heroku create ktor-sample-heroku```
### This command does two things:

Creates a new Heroku application, which is available on the web dashboard.

Adds a new Git remote called heroku to a local repository.

To deploy the application, push changes to heroku main...

```git push heroku main```
... and wait until Heroku builds and publishes the application:

...
```
remote: https://ktor-sample-heroku.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
remote:
remote: Verifying deploy... done.
```
